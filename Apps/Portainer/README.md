# Portainer

Graphical container monitoring. 

Status: not ready for use yet because of the following problems:
- Cannot see Podman container. Only see Docker container at the moments
- Traefik routing via `portainer` subdomain returns 404. I have not been able to find a solution. It might have something to do with the SSL requirement of portainer.
