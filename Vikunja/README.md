# Docker instruction

Simply use Docker compose up to start the stack with the Vikunja server and a MySQL database server

# My thought

This platform seems to tick all the boxes at a surface level. However, upon using it, I don't like it because the user interface is clunky and unintuitive. For example, it is not easy to set the relationship between activities in a Gantt chart. When I set the due date for a task, that due date does not appear in the Gantt chart. It is also quite clunky to add todo list to any due date to the task.
